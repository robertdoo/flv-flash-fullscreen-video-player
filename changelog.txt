Changelog (1.9.7):
         
              

** playerpath **
The parameter "playerpath" isn’t required any more. It’s optional now and only necessary if you use the FLVPlayer from ActionScript. 

Instead the "base" parameter of SWFObject is set to "." so the Player automatically knows its location (see http://www.yswfblog.com/blog/2008/08/11/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us/)

** End screen**
A new end screen has been introduced. The default version shows a button with replay symbol.
If you want to have a custom ending: The corresponding parameter is called "ending". You can find the flash template in "src/endings". 
                 
** Keyboard control**
The player can be controled with some keyboard shortcuts. 
- space bar: play or pause the video
- right/left arrow: fast-forwar/rewind the video             

** New JavaScript Method and Playlists **
A new function (updatePlayer) has been created that can be called from JavaScript.
So you can replace the content of the video player dynamically. You can also create playlists in HTML.
An example can be found in the download.      
   
** skinScaleMaximum **
The scale factor of the 
However, if you have performance problems in fullscreen mode, set it to 4.5 (this is the default value of the FLV Playback component).  

** volume **
There’s a new parameter called "volume". Default is 1 (=maximum), 0 equates to no sound.    

** context menu **
The standard context menu (right click on the player) has been replaced with a custom one.

** Subfolders for deploying **
I’ve introduced subfolders in the "flvplayer" folder.
- buttonoverlays
- endings
- preloaders
- skins      

** Subfolders for sources **
Analogous the deploy folder, the sources have also been restructured.                         

** Additional skins moved **
I’ve moved the additional skins to the new subfolder "flvplayer/skins" where you can access them directly using the "skin" parameter.    

** Use the player in AS3 **
For Flash Developers: The Player can be instantiated and used in ActionScript. Removed some bugs.
               
** HTML templates **
Some small changes: 
"flashvars" is now "playervars"
"videoPlayer" is now "videoCanvas" 

** SWFObject 2.1 **
Updated SWFObject to 2.1
